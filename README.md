## What is Ugolki?
[Ugolki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugolki) (or *Corners*) is a two-player board game that uses the standard checkers tokens but in a different format. There are several variations in how many tokens are placed for each player, but it usually consists of 9 to 16 tokens placed in a square shape on opposing corners of the board. You can hop over any other token with your tokens, and move one space in any orthogonal direction. The objective of the game is to recreate your opponent's starting position on their corner of the board.
